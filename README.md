# Unclick
Undetectable autoclicker in Python.

## How to use
(Only works on Windows due to libraries, might make Linux version some time)
Download source, extract, open ```main.pyw```.
Hold F24 (or change bind in ```main.pyw``` file yourself) to click.
To close, press F20 (or change bind in ```main.pyw```)

## Origin
I was getting banned for Razer autoclick feature in The Finals all the time. So I made my own autoclicker that's undetectable (well almost). It worked.

## How it works
Since I don't have any comments in my code (bc I'm lazy) I'll just quickly explain here. It uses different random delays for everything. When it starts clicking, how long it holds the button, everything to mimic a very inconsisten human. (It's very simple)
